# Architecture Implementation Summary

## Completed Reorganization

Successfully reorganized the Oscil plugin source code according to the architecture specification (architecture.md section 6).

### Directory Structure Created

```
src/
├── plugin/          # Plugin core (PluginProcessor, PluginEditor)
├── audio/           # Audio processing subsystems (ready for future)
├── dsp/            # DSP utilities (RingBuffer already here)
├── render/         # Rendering components (OscilloscopeComponent)
├── state/          # State management (ready for future)
├── theme/          # Theme management (ready for future)
├── ui/             # UI component library (ready for future)
│   ├── components/
│   └── layout/
└── util/           # Utilities (ready for future)

resources/          # Resources (icons, themes, shaders)
├── icons/
├── themes/
└── shaders/

docs/               # Documentation
├── api/
└── design/

tests/              # Tests including performance tests
└── perf/
```

### Files Moved

1. **src/PluginProcessor.h/cpp** → **src/plugin/**
2. **src/PluginEditor.h/cpp** → **src/plugin/**
3. **src/OscilloscopeComponent.h/cpp** → **src/render/**
4. **src/dsp/RingBuffer.h** → Kept in place (already correct)

### Updated Components

- ✅ Fixed all #include statements to reflect new paths
- ✅ Updated CMakeLists.txt OSCIL_SOURCES paths  
- ✅ Build system works correctly
- ✅ Plugin compiles and installs successfully
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

### Validation Results

- ✅ CMake configure succeeds
- ✅ Plugin builds without errors  
- ✅ VST3 and AU formats created
- ✅ Automatic installation to system directories works
- ✅ No functionality regression

## Next Steps

The codebase is now properly organized according to the architecture specification and ready for:

1. **bgfx integration** (Task 1.6) in src/render/
2. **Multi-track engine** (Task 3.1) in src/audio/  
3. **State management** (Task 2.2) in src/state/
4. **Theme system** (Task 2.3) in src/theme/
5. **UI components** expansion in src/ui/

All module boundaries are clearly defined and the architecture supports the planned 64-track scalability.
