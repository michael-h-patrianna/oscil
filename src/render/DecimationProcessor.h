/**
 * @class DecimationProcessor
 * @brief High-performance waveform decimation processor for LOD optimization
 *
 * Implements intelligent sample reduction algorithms to optimize rendering
 * performance when displaying large numbers of audio samples. Uses min/max
 * decimation to preserve waveform envelope characteristics while reducing
 * the number of points that need to be rendered.
 *
 * The processor automatically determines when decimation is beneficial based
 * on the ratio of samples to display pixels, applying decimation only when
 * the sample density exceeds a configurable threshold.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Automatic decimation based on pixel density analysis
 * - Min/max algorithm preserves waveform envelope characteristics
 * - Zero-allocation processing using pre-allocated buffers
 * - Configurable decimation threshold for quality vs performance tuning
 * - Thread-safe operation for real-time audio visualization
 *
 * Performance characteristics:
 * - O(n) processing complexity where n is input sample count
 * - Typical performance: <1ms for 44.1kHz datasets
 * - Memory efficient with reusable internal buffers
 * - Significant rendering speedup when decimation ratio > 2:1
 *
 * The min/max decimation algorithm works by:
 * 1. Dividing input samples into groups based on target output size
 * 2. Finding minimum and maximum values within each group
 * 3. Outputting alternating min/max values to preserve peaks and troughs
 * 4. Maintaining temporal relationships and envelope shape
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * DecimationProcessor processor;
 * auto result = processor.process(samples, 44100, 800);
 * if (result.wasDecimated) {
 *     // Use result.samples with result.sampleCount samples
 *     renderWaveform(result.samples, result.sampleCount);
 * } else {
 *     // Use original samples directly
 *     renderWaveform(samples, originalCount);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see OscilloscopeComponent
 * @note Thread-safe for single consumer, not thread-safe for concurrent access
