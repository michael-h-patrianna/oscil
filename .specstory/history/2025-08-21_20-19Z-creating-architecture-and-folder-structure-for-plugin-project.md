# Creating architecture and folder structure for plugin project (2025-08-21 20:19Z)

_**User**_

please check prd and the implementation plan. in architecture.md create the architecture, file and folder structure for the plugin project.

---

_**Assistant**_

Adding a new architecture.md file describing the system architecture and proposed folder structure. Fixing markdown lint issues in `architecture.md` (headings, lists, fenced code languages, spacing). Reading file to patch correctly with proper context before reapplying fixes. Applying patch with correct context for markdown spacing and fenced code languages. 
```

```
Fix remaining markdown spacing issues in architecture.md. 
```

```
Fix list indentation and blank line issues in remaining sections of architecture.md. 
```

```
Normalize ordered list numbering and remove extra indentation on sub-lists; add blank lines before headings. 
```

```
Switch unordered list asterisks to dashes for consistency. 
```

```
Added `architecture.md` with a full system architecture and cleaned it up for markdown linting (headings, lists, code fences, tables, spacing). Let me know if you want this split into multiple docs or if we should start scaffolding the proposed directories next.

opengl on mac is a problem.

let's pick bgfx or wgpu (native Metal on macOS, D3D12/Vulkan on Windows)

_**Assistant**_

Gathering current source and build files to design backend abstraction and update architecture. Reading existing rendering-related component to plan abstraction away from OpenGL. Reading header for oscilloscope component. 

---

_**User**_

only update architecture.md and ui-prd.md and prd.md where necessary that we do not use opengl but either bgfx or wgpu (native Metal on macOS, D3D12/Vulkan on Windows) pick one

---

_**Assistant**_

Reading existing spec files to update rendering backend references from OpenGL to bgfx. Reading `prd.md` to replace OpenGL references. Updating `architecture.md` to replace OpenGL with bgfx multi-backend rendering abstraction. Re-reading `architecture.md` to patch with accurate context indices. Applying targeted replacements in `architecture.md` for bgfx backend. 
```

```
Fix formatting issues after bgfx patch in `architecture.md` (remove stray bracket line and correct table/lint warnings). Re-read the specific section to capture exact lines for patch context. Read around line 310-330 to patch correctly. Apply patch to remove stray lines and update flags to bgfx version missed earlier, fixing memory table. 
```

```
Fix MD037 by escaping or removing emphasis markers asterisks in table row. 
```

```
Updating `ui-prd.md` to replace OpenGL with bgfx backend references. 
```

```
Fix list spacing issues in ui-prd.md. 
```

```
Searching for remaining 'OpenGL' mentions to update to bgfx across docs including prd.md. Reviewing beginning of `architecture.md` to remove remaining OpenGL references. Reading `ui-prd.md` and `prd.md` to identify remaining OpenGL references and required bgfx updates. Applying patches to remove remaining OpenGL references, align docs with bgfx, and add rendering backend section to prd.md. Searching for remaining OpenGL references across docs to patch accurately. Applying precise patches referencing line contexts to ensure correct replacements. 
```

```

```

```

```

```
Fixing markdown lint issues introduced by patches in all three updated files. Reading the specific section of `architecture.md` around list needing indentation fix to patch with accurate context. Reading earlier part of `prd.md` to patch list spacing and scenario formatting accurately. Applying targeted patches using exact context to resolve lint issues. Re-reading the specific section of `ui-prd.md` around Phase 2 to patch with correct context. Patch `ui-prd.md` to add blank line before the Phase 2 list. 
```

```

```

```

```

```
Updated all three docs:

- architecture.md: Replaced OpenGL layer with RendererBackend + bgfx, adjusted pipeline steps, risks, phases, incremental plan, directory tree.
- ui-prd.md: Switched Phase 2 item to “bgfx acceleration” and earlier tech stack now aligns.
- prd.md: Added explicit Rendering Backend Decision section (bgfx rationale + implications).

Residual (optional) follow‑ups:
- `tasks.md` still references OpenGL (now inconsistent).
- Markdown lint warnings remain (formatting only).

Confirm if you’d like me to align `tasks.md` or clean remaining lint. Let me know. GitHub Copilot

update tasks.md where our decision to replace opengl requires change or added tasks
