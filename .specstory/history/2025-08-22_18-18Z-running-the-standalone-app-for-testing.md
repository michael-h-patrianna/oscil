run the standalone app to test

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you run the standalone app to test it. Let me check the current status and run the application. Let me check if the files exist and update them accordingly. I see the files already exist. Let me read them and update them for this specific task. 
```

```
Now let me check the current state of the build and launch the standalone app: Great! The standalone app exists. Now let me launch it: The app has been launched! Let me check if it's running properly by looking at the process:

perfect. build the vst3 plugin, so i can check in ableton and bitwig that we have a solid starting point

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll build the VST3 plugin so you can test it in Ableton and Bitwig. Let me update the task tracking and then build the VST3. 
```

```
Now let me check the current VST3 build status and build it: Great! The VST3 is already built. Now let me use the provided CMake task to install it to the system location where DAWs can find it: Let me try the direct cmake command: Perfect! Now let me verify the installation: Excellent! Let me check the VST3 bundle structure to ensure it's properly formed: Perfect! Now let me check the Info.plist to verify the plugin metadata: Excellent! Now let me update the task tracking and provide testing instructions: 
```

```
Perfect! Let me also create a quick reference for testing: ## Done

The VST3 plugin has been successfully built and installed to the system location. Here's what was accomplished:

**âœ… VST3 Build & Installation Complete:**
- Plugin built as `Oscil.vst3` 
- Installed to `` for DAW discovery
- Bundle structure verified (executable, Info.plist, Resources)
- Plugin metadata confirmed (v0.1.0, bundle ID: com.oscil.audio)

**ðŸŽ¹ Ready for DAW Testing:**
- Ableton Live and Bitwig Studio should now discover the plugin after restart/rescan
- Look for "Oscil" in Effects or Utility plugin categories
- Plugin implements the JUCE-only rendering architecture (BGFX removed)
- Should display oscilloscope visualization for audio input

The plugin is now ready for real-world testing in your DAWs to validate the solid starting point with the simplified JUCE-only rendering pipeline.

ok. the plugin loads. but we added for testing to automatically play a sine wave tone. this needs to be changed now:
1. in the standalone app we use the microphone input to test
2. in the vst3, au plugins we use the actual plugin audio input

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the audio input source so that the standalone app uses microphone input for testing, while the VST3/AU plugins use the actual plugin audio input. Let me first analyze the current code to understand how the sine wave testing tone is implemented. 
```

```
Now let me search for the sine wave test implementation in the codebase: Let me read the PluginProcessor to understand the current audio processing implementation: Perfect! I can see the test sine wave generation is in the `processBlock` method. Now let me also check the PluginProcessor header to understand the structure better: Now I need to understand how JUCE detects if it's running as a standalone app vs a plugin. Let me check if there's any existing code that handles this: Let me check if there's a `CMakeLists.txt` or other build configuration that might define how the standalone vs plugin builds are configured: Now I understand the structure better. JUCE automatically handles the different plugin formats (Standalone, VST3, AU) from the same codebase. Let me implement the solution to conditionally use microphone input for standalone and plugin input for VST3/AU. I'll modify the PluginProcessor to detect the wrapper type and handle audio input accordingly. 
```

```
I need to fix the API call for detecting the wrapper type. Let me check the correct JUCE API: Let me search in a different way and check JUCE documentation about wrapper types: The documentation doesn't show the exact API I need. Let me search for how to detect the plugin wrapper type in the JUCE codebase: Let me search for the wrapper type enum: Let me search more broadly for the wrapper type detection API: Great! Now I can see that the wrapper type enum exists. Let me check the AudioProcessor header for the wrapper type enum: Perfect! Now I can see the correct API. Let me fix the code: 
```

```
Now let me build the project to test the changes: Excellent! The build was successful. Now let me install the updated VST3 plugin: Perfect! Now let me test the standalone app to verify that it now uses microphone input instead of the test tone: Now let me update the task status and document the changes: 
```

```
Let me also update the knowledge base with what was implemented: 
```

```
Perfect! Let me create a summary of what was accomplished: ## Done

The audio input source configuration has been successfully implemented! Here's what was accomplished:

**âœ… Key Changes Made:**
- **Removed** the debug sine wave test tone that was hardcoded for all formats
- **Added** conditional audio input detection based on JUCE `wrapperType`
- **Standalone app** now uses microphone/line input from the audio device
- **VST3/AU plugins** use the actual audio input from the DAW host
- **Maintained** pass-through design so the plugin acts as an analyzer/visualizer

**ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:**
- Used JUCE's `wrapperType == wrapperType_Standalone` detection
- Modified `src/plugin/PluginProcessor.cpp:processBlock()` method
- Both modes store input in ring buffers for real-time oscilloscope visualization
- Audio passes through unchanged (output = input) for proper plugin behavior

**ðŸš€ Ready for Testing:**
- All plugin formats built successfully (Standalone, VST3, AU)
- Updated VST3 plugin installed to system location for DAW discovery
- Standalone app ready for microphone input testing
- VST3 plugin ready for testing in Ableton Live and Bitwig Studio

The oscilloscope plugin now properly uses **real audio input** instead of test tones, making it ready for actual audio analysis and visualization in both standalone and plugin contexts!

the vst3 plugin works.
the standalone app does not use audio input from the microphone despite the microphone being active and the app being unmuted. could this be a permission issue in mac? i gave vscode microphone access, but cant find any option for the standalone app

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! This is likely a macOS microphone permission issue. The standalone app needs explicit microphone permissions, and since it's a debug build that's not signed/notarized, macOS might not be prompting for permissions or might be blocking access silently. 
```

```
Let me first check the current `CMakeLists.txt` to see if microphone permissions are already enabled: Let me check the juce_add_plugin call in CMakeLists.txt: I can see the issue! The `juce_add_plugin` call is missing the `MICROPHONE_PERMISSION_ENABLED TRUE` flag that's needed for macOS microphone access. Let me add it: 
```

```
Now let me rebuild the standalone app with the microphone permission flag: Great! Now let me check if the Info.plist in the standalone app was updated with microphone permissions: Perfect! I can see that the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` key has been added to the Info.plist. Now let me check the current macOS privacy settings and also launch the updated app: Let me try the correct way to open Privacy settings on macOS: Now let me launch the updated standalone app. The key thing is that now it should prompt for microphone permission when first launched: Let me also provide instructions for manually granting permissions and checking if the permission prompt appeared: Let me also add one more potential solution - code signing the app to ensure proper permission dialogs:

_**User**_

perfect works. update architecture.md with this information because we want to mainly build our increments in the standalone app for easier testing and then at specific milestone have all updates built in the plugin versions to test in a real daw

---

_**Assistant**_

Excellent! I'll update the `architecture.md` document to reflect this development workflow strategy and document the microphone permission solution. 
```

```
Now let me update the `architecture.md` document to include the development workflow and microphone permission information: Let me find a good place to add the development workflow section. Let me check the end of the document: Now let me add a new section before the "Acceptance Traceability" section to document the development workflow and audio input configuration: 
```

```
