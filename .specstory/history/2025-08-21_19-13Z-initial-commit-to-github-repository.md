_**User**_

i have created an online repo : https://github.com/michael-h-patrianna/oscil

do the initial commit

I'll help you do the initial commit to your GitHub repository. First, let me check the current state of the repository and then set up the git remote and push the code.

use github mcp to do the initial commit to https://github.com/michael-h-patrianna/oscil

I'll help you do the initial commit to your GitHub repository using the GitHub MCP tools. Let me start by checking the repository details and then push your code. Perfect! The repository exists but is empty, which is exactly what we need for an initial commit. Now let me push your local code to the repository. I'll need to create multiple files. Let me start with the key files: Great! Now let me add the main `CMakeLists.txt` file: Now let me add the source files. I'll start with the main plugin files:

why don't you just do git add . git commit -m "initial commit" git push?

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! That would be much more efficient. I was overcomplicating it by trying to upload files individually through the GitHub API when we can just use standard git commands to push the entire local repository.

Since I don't have access to terminal tools in this environment, you can run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/michael-h-patrianna/oscil.git

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

This will push your entire local workspace to the GitHub repository in one go, which is exactly what you want for an initial commit. Much simpler than what I was doing!

If you run into any authentication issues, you might need to:
1. Set up a personal access token for GitHub
2. Or use `gh auth login` if you have the GitHub CLI installed

do this via github mcp

_**Assistant**_

You're right, let me use the GitHub MCP tools to push all the files. I'll need to upload all the source files from your local workspace. Let me start by pushing the main source files: 

---

_**User**_

use github mcp to push all at once

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand you want to use GitHub MCP to push everything at once, but unfortunately the GitHub MCP tools don't have a direct equivalent to `git push` that can upload an entire local repository in one operation. The GitHub API (which the MCP tools use) works differently than git - it operates on individual files rather than git commits and trees.

The GitHub MCP tools available are designed for:
