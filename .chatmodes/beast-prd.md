# BEAST PRD - Test Updates for New Structure

## Problem & Users (JTBD)
**Problem**: Test files are failing to compile because they reference headers that have been moved to new directory locations during the architecture reorganization.

**Users**: Development team running tests to validate functionality during and after architecture changes.

**Job-to-be-Done**: Update all test files to work with the new directory structure while maintaining existing test coverage and functionality.

## Goals & Success Criteria
- All tests compile successfully with new directory structure
- No test functionality changes, only path updates
- Test coverage remains identical to before reorganization
- All tests pass with same results as before

## Scope

### In Scope
- Updating test file include paths
- Fixing any broken references in test files
- Updating CMakeLists.txt test configuration if needed
- Ensuring tests run successfully

### Out of Scope
- Adding new tests during this update
- Changing test functionality or behavior
- Performance improvements to tests
- Test framework changes

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- All existing tests must compile and run
- Test results must be identical to pre-reorganization
- Test build system must work with new structure

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Test build time should not increase significantly
- Test execution time should remain the same
- CI/testing pipeline should continue to work

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All test files compile without errors
2. All tests pass with same results as before reorganization
3. Test build completes successfully in CMake
4. No test functionality regressions introduced
